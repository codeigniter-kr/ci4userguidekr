Version 4.1.2
====================================================

Release Date: Not released

**4.1.2 release of CodeIgniter4**

Enhancements:

- New HTTP classes, ``Cookie`` and ``CookieStore``, for abstracting web cookies.

Changes:

- ``Response::getCookie`` now returns a ``Cookie`` instance instead of an array of cookie attributes.
- ``Response::getCookies`` now returns an array of ``Cookie`` instances instead of array of array of attributes.
- To eliminate warnings from modern browsers' consoles, empty samesite values will be defaulted to ``Lax`` on cookie dispatch.
- `Model::errors()` and `BaseModel::errors()` now always returns `array`; there was no definition change but the docblock has been updated.

Deprecations:

- Language strings and exceptions on invalid cookie samesite are deprecated for the ``CookieException``'s own exception message.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Response`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Security`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Session`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated ``Security::isExpired()`` to use the ``Cookie``'s internal expires status.
