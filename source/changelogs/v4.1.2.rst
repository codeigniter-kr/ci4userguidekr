Version 4.1.2
====================================================

Release Date: Not released

**4.1.2 release of CodeIgniter4**

Enhancements:

- New HTTP classes, ``Cookie`` and ``CookieStore``, for abstracting web cookies.
- New logger handler, ``ErrorlogHandler``, that writes to ``error_log()``.
- Entity. Added custom type casting functionality.

Changes:

- ``Response::getCookie`` now returns a ``Cookie`` instance instead of an array of cookie attributes.
- ``Response::getCookies`` now returns an array of ``Cookie`` instances instead of array of array of attributes.
- To eliminate warnings from modern browsers' consoles, empty samesite values will be defaulted to ``Lax`` on cookie dispatch.
- `Model::errors()` and `BaseModel::errors()` now always returns `array`; there was no definition change but the docblock has been updated.
- ``Entity::castAs`` has changed behavior. Added new parameter ``$method``. Type casting has been moved to separate handlers.
- Entity. Timestamp casting now throws an exception when an invalid value is passed
- ``Entity::castAsJson`` uses external cast handler ``CastAsJson::get``.
- ``Entity::mutateDate`` uses external cast handler ``CastAsDatetime::get``.

Deprecations:

- Language strings and exceptions on invalid cookie samesite are deprecated for the ``CookieException``'s own exception message.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Response`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Security`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated cookie-related properties of ``Session`` in order to use the ``Cookie`` class.
- Deprecated ``Security::isExpired()`` to use the ``Cookie``'s internal expires status.
- Deprecated ``CIDatabaseTestCase`` to use the ``DatabaseTestTrait`` instead.

Bugs Fixed:

- ``BaseConnection::query()`` now returns ``false`` for failed queries (unless ``DBDebug==true``, in which case an exception will be thrown) and returns boolean values for write-type queries as specified in the docs.
